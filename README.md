# RC Car App - Software Engineering 315

In a group consisting of three other people in my class, my group and I were able to achieve our inital goal of creating an
Arduino-powered, semi-autonomous car as our semester project. I found this project very fun and rewarding because it was the first time in school that my peers and I were able to pitch an idea to our professor and then create it. 

I will make sure to write more about this in a blog post soon and go into the details of the project.
